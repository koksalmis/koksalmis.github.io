    <p>Hi there !</p>

<p>I’m a Software Developer at <a href="https://www.yapikredi.com.tr/en/">YapıKredi Bank</a> which is third largest private bank in Turkey. I started as a fresh graduate developing and maintaninig internal tools and products for Employees and customers  at Credit Card Payment Systems unit. In the beginnig, I had no idea about fintech and did not even what the credit card statement is :) Because of my colleagues understandings and kindness I got used to team and our job.Then after 1 year I worked and finish 1 project, solved bunch of bugs, and did some improvements in tools that we used. Mostly, I were using two private framework which are Harmoni and Ocean framework. These are also core frameworks in Bank’s tech stack now. Harmoni is written in JAVA, Hibernate, Spring Framework and Ocean is written in C# based on .NET technologies, both of them use ORACLE technologies as DB. That was my first part :) It was not easy but learned a lot :)</p>

<p>Then now, started Virtual Payment Systems unit. Again, I have no idea about it except using e-commerce websites daily life :) But after some research and technologies, it makes me excited. We will see what brings to us :)</p>
